# Natural Scene Text Detector

This Project was developed by Aayush Kumar, Core Member of Epoch (2022-2023)

## About the project:

This project was made for detecting and recognizing text in natural scene. Major libraries used are OpenCV and Tesseract. It also uses pre-trained east model for detecting regions of text.

## Setup:

To run this file, we need to download tesseract library and a pre-trained east model.

* Tessesract can be downloaded from [here](https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Downloads.html)
* East can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelmurat/frozen-east-text-detection)

To run the file, change the location of east model to the location at which east is present in your system.
