# Handwritten digit recognition using canvas
This Project was developed by Anshul Sangrame, Core Member of Epoch (2022-2023)
## About the Project:
This Project recogonizes single digit number drawn on canvas. Major python libraries used in this project are tensorflow for developing the deep learning model, tkinter module for GUI and openCV and Pillow for preprocessing of image

## Setup
* Make sure you have all libraries mentioned in requirement.txt using the command:
```bash
pip install -r requirement.txt
```
* Installation of tkinter for GUI:
    * Ubuntu:
    ```bash
    sudo apt install python3-tk
    ```
    * Windows:
    ```bash
    pip install tk
    ```
* Run the program
```bash
python3 main.py
```
* If you want to rebuild the learning model
